# simple-dash

A simple, fully responsive Dashboard to forward to the services of your choice! Ideal for Desktop and mobile usage!
Add all of your services, whether you host them yourself or not and display them as neat Icons from the FontAwesome libary.
simple-dash is made to be as simple and minimalistic as possible. (The goal was to create a dashboard even my mom could use!) :)
